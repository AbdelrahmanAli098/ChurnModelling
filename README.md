# ChurnModelling
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify key patterns and trends. Using Python, we perform data loading, exploration, and preprocessing to understand factors influencing customer retention. We leverage visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into churn behavior. The goal is to prepare and refine the dataset for future predictive modeling or business intelligence reporting.
